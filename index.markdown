### Hi,

As of January 2026, I work as a labor market advisor and researcher at the [Employee Insurance Agency of the Netherlands (UWV)](https://www.uwv.nl){:target="_blank"}, within the [department of Labor Market Information and Advice](https://www.uwv.nl/nl/arbeidsmarktinformatie){:target="_blank"}. In this role, I analyse developments in labor demand and supply and individual employment transitions, including entry into work and exits to unemployment or inactivity.

Before joining UWV, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Sociology](https://www.rug.nl/gmw/organisation/about-us/departments/sociology/){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl){:target="_blank"}, where my research focused on social stratification and labour market inequality. I worked within the NWO VIDI–funded project ["Beyond boardrooms"](https://www.rug.nl/gmw/news/220708-lippenyi){:target="_blank"}, studying how the introduction of a legally mandated gender boardroom quota affected gender inequality and careers in Dutch organizations.

I obtained my [PhD](https://hdl.handle.net/11245.1/dad513af-a49e-4ea2-8936-f18e0969cf2e){:target="_blank"} in 2024 from the University of Amsterdam. In my doctoral research, I studied wage inequality in the Netherlands using linked employer–employee data from Dutch social insurance registries.

If you are interested in my work or would like to get in touch, feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:christoph.janietz@uwv.nl).
