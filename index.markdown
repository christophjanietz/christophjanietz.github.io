### Hi,

I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Sociology](https://www.rug.nl/gmw/sociology/?lang=en){:target="_blank"} of [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl){:target="_blank"} .

I am mostly interested in issues related to social stratification. In my PhD thesis project, I did research on wage inequality in the Netherlands using linked employer-employee population data from the Dutch tax registries. If you want to know more about my research, have a look [here](https://www.uva.nl/en/shared-content/faculteiten/en/faculteit-der-maatschappij-en-gedragswetenschappen/news/2023/06/wage-inequality-between-organisations-is-growing.html?origin=PDQcb5%2BfSuSJvUewdsszdA){:target="_blank"}.

If you are interested in my research, feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:c.janietz@rug.nl).
