### Hi,

I am a PhD candidate at the [Department of Sociology](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/organisation/faculties/faculty-of-social-and-behavioural-sciences/disciplines/sociology/sociology.html){:target="_blank"} of [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uu.nl/en){:target="_blank"} .

I am mostly interested in issues related to social stratification and wage inequality.

If you are interested in my research, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:c.janietz@uva.nl).
