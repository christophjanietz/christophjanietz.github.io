  <summary>Abstract</summary>

Most education systems regulate school entry by using a specific annual cut-off date to group children into starting cohorts. Although this practice limits developmental heterogeneity in the classroom, some children still enter school up to almost 12 months younger than the oldest student in the same cohort. These assigned differences in school entry age strongly affect student achievement during the early stages of schooling. Although studies have found a weakening impact of relative age on school performance in higher grades, this effect varies considerably across countries. In this study, we analysed the effect of early tracking on the development of performance gaps in math, science, and reading between relatively old and young students. Relatively young students may be particularly prone to  track misallocation. The different learning environments for relatively old and young students during secondary education may preserve the initial performance gap. Using international test scores from TIMSS, PIRLS, and PISA, we demonstrate the importance of the sampling design in obtaining reliable estimates of the relative age effect. In line with previous research, we observed that the impact of relative age on school performance decreases over time. However, the results of our difference-in-differences analyses suggest that these age inequalities decline less strongly in early-tracking countries.

**Essential workers and wage inequality: Wage differentials before and during the Covid-19 pandemic, 2006 to 2022**

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>

In 2020, several governments declared specific occupations as essential for maintaining the functioning of society in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. A current question in the public debate on fair pay is whether essential workers are sufficiently remunerated. Using data from the Netherlands, I analyze the wages of essential workers relative to other workers before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. Results indicate that essential workers earn less relative to other workers within higher-paid strata of the occupational structure, while they earn more within lower-paid strata. These wage differentials are shaped by gender composition and sectoral employment. I employ a difference-in-differences design based on quarterly data between January 2017 and September 2022 to assess whether the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic affected wage differentials due to an increasing public appreciation of essential work. Results indicate that the collective experience of the Covid-19 pandemic has not benefited essential workers in the short-term.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

Recent research suggests that occupational positions and organizational structures intersect during the formation of wage inequality over the working career. Using administrative data from the Netherlands, I investigate whether workers who start in different occupational positions experience unequal wage growth while remaining employed in an organization. Results show that workers in professional and managerial positions experience larger wage growth than workers in lower-status occupational positions. After six years of staying at the same organization, predicted wage growth rates vary between 5.44% for production workers and 10.18% for technical professionals. These findings indicate that occupational stratification has a dynamic component that unfolds at the level of organizations. I test whether occupational sorting across organizations with differing pay quality mediates part of the occupation-based heterogeneity in wage growth. The results indicate that occupational sorting is marked but that sorting explains only up to around 8% of heterogeneity in firm-internal wage growth between occupational positions in the Dutch labor market.

Wage inequality between workers with different levels of educational attainment has been shown to increase over the life course. In this study, we investigate to what extent this growth is explained by temporary employment. Using linked employer-employee register data from the Netherlands, we follow the labor market careers of workers born in 1979. We decompose the impact of temporary employment on the change in the educational wage gap over the life course into two distinct components: (a) changes in the group-specific temporary employment rates (group-specific risk) and (b) changes in the group-specific effects of temporary employment on wages (group-specific vulnerability). In line with previous research, we find a marked growth of the educational wage gap over the life course. While group differences in temporary employment risk changed throughout the observation period to the detriment of lower-educated workers, group differences in vulnerability to temporary employment increased specifically during the early life course. Overall, temporary employment explains approximately 9% of the change in the wage gap between workers with different levels of educational attainment by the age of 38 relative to age 28 in the Netherlands.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

Recent studies have identified both occupations and organizations as important structures underpinning wage inequality in the labor market. In this article we investigate how the two structures might work together in explaining inequality. More specifically, we study how organizations affect between- and within-occupation inequality. Using a combination of Dutch linked employer-employee register data and the Dutch labor force survey, we find that organizations are more important in explaining wage differentials between occupations than wage inequality between workers with the same occupation. While organizations are far away from solely driving heterogeneity in pay among workers in the same occupation, we find that the sorting of high-paying occupations in high-paying firms (and vice versa) is an important mechanism by which both structures affect inequality. Our findings emphasize the importance of moving away from an isolated study of occupations or organizations towards an analytical integration of both structures for understanding wage inequality.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

The occupational structure, the aggregate distribution of workers across different job roles that link people to pay, has long served as the dominant framework for understanding the unequal allocation of economic rewards in society. At the same time, recent empirical trends indicate that organizations are accountable for rising wage inequality in many countries. Organizations represent social spaces where economic resources are pooled and decisions regarding their distribution across workers are negotiated. Based on quantitative analyses of large-scale administrative data, this dissertation unpacks how occupations - ‘what’ people work - and organizations - ‘where’ people work - intersect during the formation of wage inequality. It addresses questions regarding the aggregate structure of wage inequality and studies how individual life chances are shaped by occupations and organizations in the Netherlands.
