  <summary>Abstract</summary>

In 2020, several governments declared specific occupations as essential for maintaining the functioning of society in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. A current question in the public debate on fair pay is whether essential workers are sufficiently remunerated. Using data from the Netherlands, I analyze the wages of essential workers relative to other workers before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. Results indicate that essential workers earn less relative to other workers within higher-paid strata of the occupational structure, while they earn more within lower-paid strata. These wage differentials are shaped by gender composition and sectoral employment. I employ a difference-in-differences design based on quarterly data between January 2017 and September 2022 to assess whether the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic affected wage differentials due to an increasing public appreciation of essential work. Results indicate that the collective experience of the Covid-19 pandemic has not benefited essential workers in the short-term.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

Recent research suggests that occupational positions and organizational structures intersect during the formation of wage inequality over the working career. Using administrative data from the Netherlands, I investigate whether workers who start in different occupational positions experience unequal wage growth while remaining employed in an organization. Results show that workers in professional and managerial positions experience larger wage growth than workers in lower-status occupational positions. After six years of staying at the same organization, predicted wage growth rates vary between 5.44% for production workers and 10.18% for technical professionals. These findings indicate that occupational stratification has a dynamic component that unfolds at the level of organizations. I test whether occupational sorting across organizations with differing pay quality mediates part of the occupation-based heterogeneity in wage growth. The results indicate that occupational sorting is marked but that sorting explains only up to around 8% of heterogeneity in firm-internal wage growth between occupational positions in the Dutch labor market.

Wage inequality between workers with different levels of educational attainment has been shown to increase over the life course. In this study, we investigate to what extent this growth is explained by temporary employment. Using linked employer-employee register data from the Netherlands, we follow the labor market careers of workers born in 1979. We decompose the impact of temporary employment on the change in the educational wage gap over the life course into two distinct components: (a) changes in the group-specific temporary employment rates (group-specific risk) and (b) changes in the group-specific effects of temporary employment on wages (group-specific vulnerability). In line with previous research, we find a marked growth of the educational wage gap over the life course. While group differences in temporary employment risk changed throughout the observation period to the detriment of lower-educated workers, group differences in vulnerability to temporary employment increased specifically during the early life course. Overall, temporary employment explains approximately 9% of the change in the wage gap between workers with different levels of educational attainment by the age of 38 relative to age 28 in the Netherlands.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

Recent studies have identified both occupations and organizations as important structures underpinning wage inequality in the labor market. In this article we investigate how the two structures might work together in explaining inequality. More specifically, we study how organizations affect between- and within-occupation inequality. Using a combination of Dutch linked employer-employee register data and the Dutch labor force survey, we find that organizations are more important in explaining wage differentials between occupations than wage inequality between workers with the same occupation. While organizations are far away from solely driving heterogeneity in pay among workers in the same occupation, we find that the sorting of high-paying occupations in high-paying firms (and vice versa) is an important mechanism by which both structures affect inequality. Our findings emphasize the importance of moving away from an isolated study of occupations or organizations towards an analytical integration of both structures for understanding wage inequality.

**Boardroom Quotas and Gender Disparities in Pay and Representation: The Dutch Case** \

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
There are ongoing discussions about whether corporate boardroom quotas impact gender equality within organizations beyond the level of leadership. We examine the impact of the Dutch target law – a weakly enforced quota policy applying to a wide range of firms – on gender wage disparities and female representation across organizational levels. Our findings are ambivalent: while the quota did not reduce the gender wage gap in targeted firms relative to comparable firms, it did increase women’s representation in higher organizational wage echelons below the board. Using linked employer-employee register data and both regression discontinuity and difference-in-differences designs, we show evidence of a gradual shift towards greater gender parity in top employee income quartiles, without corresponding wage equalization. These findings highlight how boardroom quotas, even with weak enforcement, can produce compositional shifts without equalization, providing new empirical evidence and theoretical insight into the mechanisms through which in-stitutional reforms shape inequality.

**Leaving for More or Settling for Less: Gendered Salary Trajectories after Leaving Academia** \
(with Anne Maaike Mulders (first author), Bas Hofstra, and Jochem Tolsma) 
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Gender inequality in scientific careers has been documented in a variety of outcomes including access to professor positions, career length, scientific impact, and productivity. Much less is known about the careers of scholars who leave academia at some point. This is an important knowledge gap, since the majority of those who obtain a PhD will not keep working in academia. Furthermore, women PhDs leave the university at higher rates than men, and while this has thus far been assumed to be a negative outcome, the (gendered) effects of this transition out of academia are understudied. The consequences of transitions later in the career are especially unknown. Our paper addresses this knowledge gap by studying the salary development of men and women PhDs over a period up to 17 years. To do so, we use survey data from 21,350 individuals who obtained doctorate at universities in the Netherlands, linked to Dutch register data on salaries, job characteristics and family composition. Because we have access to detailed information about doctoral recipients’ jobs, we are able to pinpoint the transition out of academia and analyse its impact on salary trajectories. We further enrich our findings by testing whether different push and pull factors (i.e. temporary employment, work hours, having a young child, disciplinary background) can help to explain why men and women’s salaries may develop differently following a transition out of academia. Consequently, we provide a detailed but nuanced account of gender inequality in researchers’ careers beyond academia in the Netherlands.

**The effect of early tracking on relative age effects in education** \

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

Most education systems regulate school entry by using a specific annual cut-off date to group children into starting cohorts. Prior research shows that relatively younger students often perform worse than their older peers, with this gap diminishing over time. However, this effect varies across countries. Our study analyses how early tracking influences performance gaps in math, science, and reading. Using TIMSS, PIRLS, and PISA data, we find that in early tracking countries, age-related inequalities decline more slowly than in late tracking countries. Policy responses could include delaying tracking or offering flexibility to address misallocations later.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

In its original conception, the metaphor of the glass ceiling has clear organizational roots. It describes a vertical form of job sex segregation by portraying the hidden, but systemic, barriers that prevent women from climbing career ladders within organizations. Yet, research that treats the glass ceiling as an organizational phenomenon  has often been limited to single-firm or single-industry case studies due to data constraints. In this paper, I leverage administrative linked employer-employee earnings data from 2011 to 2023 to comprehensively describe variability and change of the glass ceiling in the total population of larger organizations in the Netherlands. I explicitly conceptualize the glass ceiling as an organization-level outcome captured by the under-representation of women in the highest-paid jobs within an organization. Based on earnings data available for all existing jobs, I fully reconstruct the existing job hierarchy in each organization and trace the distribution of men and women within it. I demonstrate the advantages of this approach by testing several hypotheses regarding the extent to which the glass ceiling varies both between organizations and within organizations across time.

**Cracks in the glass ceiling? Interorganizational diffusion of gender diversity among company executives following quota regulation in the Netherlands** \

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

Women remain underrepresented in organizational leadership positions throughout the European Union. To achieve a broad representation of women in top management, several European governments have introduced quotas for women on boards of large and highly visible private companies. A key assumption behind these policies is that their impact extends beyond the few directly targeted companies and spills over to other firms, resulting in widespread progress toward gender equality. However, spillover to other non-targeted firms remains understudied. Using administrative data on the total population of Dutch non-financial companies and the appointment of company directors between 2011 and 2022, we apply a heterogeneous diffusion model to assess how gender diversity in organizational leadership spreads across the wider population of private firms following the introduction of a weakly enforced quota for women on boards in the Netherlands. We study whether compliance by companies directly targeted by the quota influences other non-targeted but socially proximate firms to adopt similar practices. We analyse whether compliance norms are transmitted through inter-firm connections by considering three plausible conduits of diffusion: organizational fields, spatial proximity, and boardroom interlocks. Our analyses contribute to the understanding of the role of weakly enforced regulations in shaping broader organizational behaviour and provide insights into how gender diversity in corporate leadership can diffuse across the wider population of private firms. The results have implications for policymaking by highlighting the extent to which quota policies can result in widespread change, even in the absence of stringent enforcement.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

The occupational structure, the aggregate distribution of workers across different job roles that link people to pay, has long served as the dominant framework for understanding the unequal allocation of economic rewards in society. At the same time, recent empirical trends indicate that organizations are accountable for rising wage inequality in many countries. Organizations represent social spaces where economic resources are pooled and decisions regarding their distribution across workers are negotiated. Based on quantitative analyses of large-scale administrative data, this dissertation unpacks how occupations - ‘what’ people work - and organizations - ‘where’ people work - intersect during the formation of wage inequality. It addresses questions regarding the aggregate structure of wage inequality and studies how individual life chances are shaped by occupations and organizations in the Netherlands.
